    1.1. Criando a classe ItemCardapio
        In this study, the instructors (Laís and Guilherme) create three classes: ItemCardapio, Prato, and Bebida. They
        define the initialization method for ItemCardapio but only specify initial parameters for Prato and Bebida. The
        teachers note that both Prato and Bebida have identical properties to ItemCardapio, which leads to the next
        topic's focus on inheritance.

    1.2. Herança
        Guilherme explains that to makePratoa child ofItemCardapio, it’s needed to include the parent class name in pa-
        rentheses. Within the child's__init__function, use super().__init__(var1, var2) to initialize the parent class
        variables. However, any unique properties of the child class should be initialized separately.

    1.3. Acessando os itens do cardápio
        With both classes ready for use, Laís imports them into the app class and creates instances: watermelon juice
        using the Bebida class, and bread using the Prato class. Guilherme suggests improving the output by defining a
        new printing method. He edits the native __str__ method inside Bebida, replacing the console output with the
        object's name.
